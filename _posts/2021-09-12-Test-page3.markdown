Iâ€™m excited to share a project Iâ€™ve been working on recentlyâ€”a simple web app that helps you save and organize information about your friends. ðŸŽ‰

Why I Built This App
We all have those moments when we forget a friendâ€™s email or other important details. I wanted to create a tool that makes it easy to store and retrieve this information quickly. Plus, it was a great opportunity to practice my web development skills!

How It Works
The app is straightforward and user-friendly. Hereâ€™s a quick rundown of its features:

Input Form: You can enter your friendâ€™s name and email.
Friends List: The app displays a list of all the friends youâ€™ve added, making it easy to find their information later.
