As a fervent admirer of strategy games and a devotee of Croatian culture, I’ve embarked on an ambitious project: to create a mod for Unciv that introduces Croatia as a playable civilization. This blog post marks the beginning of what I hope will be an enriching journey into game development and historical exploration.

Why Croatia?

Croatia’s rich tapestry of history, culture, and natural beauty makes it a perfect candidate for Unciv’s diverse roster of civilizations. From the ancient walls of Dubrovnik to the pioneering spirit of its people, Croatia has much to offer on the digital battlefield.
