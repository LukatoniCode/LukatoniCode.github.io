As a passionate fan of strategy games and a proud enthusiast of Croatian culture, I embarked on a journey to bring the rich history and vibrant heritage of Croatia to one of my favorite games, Unciv. Today, I am thrilled to announce the completion of a mod that introduces Croatia as a fully playable civilization!
