<!-- outline-start -->
I’m thrilled to share that I’ve embarked on a new project: creating a weather website using Ruby on Rails! 

Why a Weather Website?
Weather affects our daily lives in so many ways, from planning our outfits to deciding whether to carry an umbrella. I wanted to create a platform that provides accurate and up-to-date weather information in a user-friendly way.

Why Ruby on Rails?
Ruby on Rails is a powerful and flexible framework that allows for rapid development. Its convention over configuration philosophy makes it easier to get started and stay productive. Plus, the Rails community is incredibly supportive, which is a huge bonus!

What to Expect
Here’s a sneak peek at what I’m planning for the website:

Real-time Weather Updates: Get the latest weather information for any location.
User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive design to make navigation a breeze.
Customizable Features: Options to save favorite locations and receive weather alerts.

I’ll be documenting my progress and sharing updates along the way. Stay tuned for more posts where I’ll dive into the technical details, challenges, and milestones of this exciting project.

Happy coding!
